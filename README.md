# Code Refactor Challenge One

## Description

Given a marketing website starter code, I refactored the code to meet the following objectives
- Website meets accessibility standards
- Source code contains semantic HTML elements
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Viewing image elements provides accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- The title element is concise and descriptive

I had some success with refactoring the code, and I had some failures. While attempting to utilize semantic HTML, I lost some essential properties within the CSS. I learned that the structure and orginization of the code is critical. I need to review more of the basic features of HTML and CSS because I need a more solid foundation of the building blocks of these in order to succeed in the future. 

# User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
